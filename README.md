# check multiple checkboxes
In this challenge, the user checks a checkbox, holds shift and checks another checkbox, in order to get all the checkboxes in between automatically checked, the algorithm was pretty challenging for me, but i've managed to make it work at the end. I've practiced basic dom traversing and learned about shiftKey property.
